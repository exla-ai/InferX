# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you get started with the Exla SDK quickly. We'll walk through installation and run a simple example using the CLIP model.

## Installation

Install the Exla SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install exla-sdk
```

For Jetson devices, we recommend using Python 3.10 for optimal performance:

```bash
# Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment
python3.10 -m venv exla-env
source exla-env/bin/activate

# Install Exla SDK
pip install exla-sdk
```

## Running Your First Model

Let's run a simple example using the CLIP model, which can match images with text descriptions.

### 1. Prepare Your Images

Save some test images to work with. For this example, we'll use two images:

```bash
# Create a data directory
mkdir -p data

# Download sample images
wget -O data/dog.jpg https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1543466835-00a7907e9de1
wget -O data/cat.jpg https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1514888286974-6c03e2ca1dba
```

### 2. Create a Simple Script

Create a file named `clip_example.py` with the following content:

```python
from exla.models.clip import clip
import json

# Initialize the model (automatically detects your hardware)
model = clip()

# Run inference
results = model.inference(
    image_paths=["data/dog.jpg", "data/cat.jpg"],
    text_queries=["a photo of a dog", "a photo of a cat", "a photo of a bird"]
)

# Print results
print(json.dumps(results, indent=2))
```

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python clip_example.py
```

You'll see real-time progress with animated spinners as the model loads and runs inference:

### 4. Understand the Results

The output will be a JSON structure showing how well each image matches each text query:

```json
[
  {
    "a photo of a dog": [
      {
        "image_path": "data/dog.jpg",
        "score": "23.1011"
      },
      {
        "image_path": "data/cat.jpg",
        "score": "17.1396"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "a photo of a cat": [
      {
        "image_path": "data/cat.jpg",
        "score": "25.3045"
      },
      {
        "image_path": "data/dog.jpg",
        "score": "18.7532"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "a photo of a bird": [
      {
        "image_path": "data/dog.jpg",
        "score": "15.9280"
      },
      {
        "image_path": "data/cat.jpg",
        "score": "15.9280"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Higher scores indicate better matches between the image and text.

## Try the RoboPoint Model

Let's also try the RoboPoint model, which can predict keypoint affordances in images based on natural language instructions.

### 1. Prepare Your Images

Save a test image to work with:

```bash
# Create a data directory if you haven't already
mkdir -p data

# Download a sample image
wget -O data/table.jpg https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1565791380713-1756b9a05343
```

### 2. Create a Simple Script

Create a file named `robopoint_example.py` with the following content:

```python
from exla.models.robopoint import robopoint

# Initialize the model (automatically detects your hardware)
model = robopoint()

# Run inference with a text instruction
model.inference(
    image_path="data/table.jpg",
    text_instruction="Find a few spots where I could place a cup on the empty area of the table.",
    output="data/table_output.png"
)

print("Output saved to data/table_output.png")
```

### 3. Run the Script

```bash
python robopoint_example.py
```

The model will process the image and generate an output image with keypoints visualized based on your text instruction.
