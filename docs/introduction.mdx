# Welcome to Exla

Exla is an advanced model optimization platform that makes AI models smaller, faster, and more deployable on constrained devices. We provide hardware-aware model optimization, enabling developers to deploy efficient, production-ready models with just a few lines of code.

## Key Features

- **Hardware-Aware Optimization:** Automatically selects the best implementation for your hardware platform.
- **Model Compression:** Reduces model size and tries to maintain accuracy
- **Deployment Tools:** Simplifies model deployment on edge devices.

## Why Exla?

Optimizing models for edge devices like NVIDIA Jetsons and Raspberry Pis is notoriously complex and time-consuming. Exla automates this process, making it possible to run large models on low-power hardware without sacrificing performance.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. First, request an access token by emailing us at contact@exla.ai

2. Once you have your token, install Exla using `uv`:
```bash
uv pip install --index-url https://pypi.exla.ai/<your-token>/simple exla
```

### Basic Usage

#### Running DeepSeek (starts a OpenWebUI frontend)
```python
from exla.models.deepseek_r1 import deepseek_r1

# Initialize the model
model = deepseek_r1()

model.run()
```

#### Running RoboPoint
```python
from exla.models.robopoint import robopoint

# Initialize the model
model = robopoint()

# Run inference with a text instruction
model.inference(
    image_path="path/to/image.jpg",
    text_instruction="Find a few spots where I could place an object.",
    output="path/to/output.png" # optional
)
```

#### Running Your Custom Model
```python
from exla.optimize import optimize_model

model_path = "efficientnet_b0_full.pt"
optimized_model = optimize_model(
    model_path
)
```
